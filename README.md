# jesh (Jesse Shell)

A container for portable zsh

# Run it

    docker run -it \
        -v $(which docker):$(which docker) \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v $HOME:$HOME \
        -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
        -v $HOME/csconfig:/root/.config
        -e DATA=$HOME \
        --hostname=$HOSTNAME \
        jesse/shell

# Make your own

create your own zshrc, build from a Dockerfile as follows

    FROM jesse/zsh
    COPY zshrc /root/.zshrc

run as above.

# Notes

With the docker socket being mounted in, any containers created inside this zsh
container will be ~~sibling~~ containers. The volume paths will be from the host
environment's context. This is why I mount `$HOME:$HOME` so the paths inside and
outside will match.

I provide the `$DATA` environment variable as a way to use aliases that expect
to be able to mount the user's data directory (see .zshrc)
